Course Description
==================

Computer Science II introduces object-oriented programming, data
structures, more sophisticated algorithms than you saw in CS 171, and
some basics of software development. You are not expected to have any
prior experience with Python. CS 171 (Computer Science I) is a
prerequisite.

In terms of the ACM's Computer Science Curriculum 2013, this course
addresses the following knowledge areas:

-   Algorithms and Complexity (AL)

-   Discrete Structures (DS)

-   Programming Languages (PL)

-   Software Development Fundamentals (SDF)

-   Software Engineering (SE)

Course Goals
============

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1.  Read and write code in the Python programming language, observing
    stylistic conventions.
2.  Design and implement object-oriented applications incorporating both
    new code and existing libraries.
3.  Solve computational problems using recursion.
4.  Use, implement, explain, and compare various data structures and
    algorithms. Data structures include stacks, queues, and lists.
    Implementations include array-based and linked versions.    
5. Write unit tests.

Grading
=======

Your course grade is assigned using the table below. Each row describes the *minimum* number of Successful results (indicated by points in Google Classroom) needed to achieve the corresponding grade. To earn a grade, you must complete **all** the requirements listed in the row for that grade. The numbers in parentheses are the total number of that assignment that has been planned, but may change accordingly throughout the semester. 

|   | **Codingbats (2)**    | **Programming Practices (7)**    | **Projects (4)**                 |
|---|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| A | 2                     | 7 M's (including at least 4 E's) | 3 M's (including at least 2 E's) |
| B | 2                     | 5 M's                            | 2 M's                            |
| C | 1                     | 3 M's                            | 1 M                              |
| D | 1                     | 2 M                              | 0 M                              |

If the requirements for a D are not met, a grade of F will be given.

Once your grade is calculated as above, a plus or minus grade will be given as follows:
- A **plus (+)** is given if you earn an 85% or higher on the final exam; *or* you earn 50% or higher and have gotten an M or above on at least one additional project over the requirement for your current grade.
- A **minus (-)** is given if you earn a 50% or lower on the final exam.
Note that there is no D- grade; in that case an F will be given.


Expectations
============

You must follow the college's [Academic Integrity
Policy](https://docs.lclark.edu/undergraduate/policiesprocedures/academicintegrity/).
You are more than welcome (in fact, encouraged!) to collaborate on
assignments with others and ask for help. However, your work must be
your own and you should be able to at least explain your work. I reserve
the right to ask follow-up questions about any work you turn in if it
seems too similar to someone else's work.

You must wear a mask indoors in accordance to the college's masking
policy. If masking is not required, you are encouraged to be thoughtful
of the safety of myself and your peers as you consider your masking
habits.

Textbook
========

We will be using [*Introduction to Programming in Python: An
Interdisciplinary
Approach*](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/), Second
Edition, by Sedgewick and Wayne. You are expected to do the readings
from each section as assigned each day.

In addition to the book,
[Pythonorama](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama) is a resource
created by fellow CS2 instructors Peter Drake and Alain KÃ¤gi. These
pages are very useful as a reference for Python and other more specific
topics.

How to Get Help
===============

The Symbolic & Quantitative Resource Center (SQRC) is an informal, free,
and student-run drop-in tutoring center. The SQRC is located in JR
Howard 134 (across from Watzek Library). It is open from 10am-10pm
Monday-Thursday, with limited hours on Friday and Sunday. If you need
help with this class, check the [SQRC
website](https://college.lclark.edu/departments/mathematical_sciences/sqrc/)
for a schedule of what tutors are helping with different classes, or
just come on by! No appointment needed.

[SAAB
tutoring](https://college.lclark.edu/academics/support/advising/saab-tutoring/)
is also available. One-on-one peer tutors are available for a range of
courses across departments. [Request to be connected with a SAAB
tutor.](https://college.lclark.edu/academics/support/advising/saab-tutoring/request-a-tutor/)

My office hours are from 1-3pm on Wednesdays, and 1:30-3:30 on
Thursdays. I'm also available for appointments on other days.

Natalie's office hours are from 5-6pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays in Olin
309.

Mental Health Resources
=======================

College can be a stressful experience. If you are experiencing mental
health issues in this class or others, there are many resources
available to you:

-   The college's Office of Student Accessibility (OSA) offers a wide
    range of supports, including accommodations and counseling.

-   You are more than welcome to chat with me about any needs you may
    have, if you are comfortable. I hope you find me to be a flexible
    and understanding member of this community.

-   If you are concerned about someone, you may want to contact the
    college's Welfare Intervention Network (WIN) or Campus Safety.
